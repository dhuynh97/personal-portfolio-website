A similar build of an internal webscraping tool I developed to collect private equity client contacts for [Bainbridge Consulting](https://bainbridgeconsulting.com). 
<br> Overall, it resulted in collecting over 1,000 prospective client contacts for the firm's business development pipeline. 
<br>I developed this using the [Selenium](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/) python library for HTML scraping and [pyXL](https://www.python-excel.org/) for additional Microsoft Excel compatibility.
