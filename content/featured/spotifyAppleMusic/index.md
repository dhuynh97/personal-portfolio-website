A fullstack application I built so my friends could drop me a note to keep in touch at this extremely isolating time! 
<br>I developed this using <a href = 'https://reactjs.org/' target = '_blank'>React</a> for the front-end and <a href = 'https://firebase.google.com/' target = '_blank'> Google Firebase</a> for the back-end database support. This build supports live server-side updates and I've also implemented <a href= 'https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web' target = '_blank'>Google Sign-In</a> for easy user authentication.
