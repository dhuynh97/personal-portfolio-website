A similar build of an internal webscraping tool I developed to collect private equity client contacts for <a href = 'https://bainbridgeconsulting.com' target="_blank">Bainbridge Consulting</a>.
<br> Overall, it resulted in collecting over 1,000 prospective client contacts for the firm's business development pipeline. 
<br>I developed this using the <a href = 'https://pypi.org/project/selenium/' target="_blank">Selenium </a> python library for HTML scraping and <a href = 'https://www.python-excel.org/' target="_blank">pyXL </a> for additional Microsoft Excel compatibility.
