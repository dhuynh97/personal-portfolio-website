My personal portfolio website deployed and hosted using <a href = 'https://app.netlify.com/sites/danielhuynh/deploys'>Netlify</a>. Developed with the much faster and optimized React-based framework, <a href = 'https://www.gatsbyjs.com/'>GatsbyJS</a>. I've also integrated Google Analytics into the website to ensure uptime and analyze visitor insights.
